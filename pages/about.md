    <p>I’m Dr. Nandini Yadava, a postdoctoral researcher at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility (General Atomics). I study how the boundary of a tokamak—its scrape-off layer and divertor—controls power and particle exhaust. My research combines spectroscopy and edge-plasma physics to understand and optimize divertor detachment, a regime that is essential for protecting future reactor materials.
I specialize in Balmer-line diagnostics and related analysis methods that separate excitation from recombination, quantify neutral/ion sources and sinks, and track impurity and molecule-assisted processes (EIR/MAR). I work closely with DIII-D collaborators to design shots, commission and calibrate optical systems, and interpret measurements alongside transport modeling. A recurring theme in my work is turning line-integrated signals into physics-based, spatially aware inferences that can guide scenario development and control.
Before joining DIII-D, I contributed to tokamak programs including ADITYA-U, where I investigated recycling, impurity influx, and edge temperature using spectroscopy and imaging. Across projects I enjoy translating complex diagnostics into clear, actionable results for operations and theory teams.
My goal is to help bridge diagnostics, modeling, and control so that power-exhaust solutions for reactor-relevant conditions are robust and repeatable.
Keywords: divertor detachment, edge/SOL transport, Balmer spectroscopy, impurity/neutral dynamics, EIR/MAR, power exhaust, tokamak diagnostics.
